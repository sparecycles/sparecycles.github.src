adam-f.github.src
=================

This is the source for http://adam-f.github.com

Edit the (haml) sources in ./source/
Change how it generates in ./generate

you will need to 
  gem install haml
and also download and install a recentish (compatible with antinode)
node.js somehow to run the server.

generate by running ./generate
generate and run the server with ./generate --run
generate and push to adam-f.github.com with ./generate --push
run the server with ./server/run

That's about it, it's MY website for ME anyway, so buzz off. =)
