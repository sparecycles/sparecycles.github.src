    My name is Adam Freidin
.slide
  .slide-content
    I am a programmer.
.slide
  .from 1987
  .to 1992
  .slide-content
    %p I was introduced to computers when I was little...
    %img{:src=>"early.jpg"}
.slide
  .from 1992
  .to 1993
  .slide-content
    \...and started programming when I was 10.
.slide
  .slide-content
    By the end of highschool I knew Pascal and C (and C++), (and a
    really poorly implemented language I developed 
    because I didn't know that I couldn't), also T
    %span.tex-e>< E
    X, and a teensy bit o' Forth.
.slide
  .from 2001
  .to 2005
  .slide-content
    I studied at UCSC and received a planned BA in Mathematics,
    and an unplanned BS in Computer Science.
.slide
  .from 2002
  .to 2005
  .slide-content
    At UCSC, I experienced more C, C++,
    ML, Lisp, Scheme, Prolog, SQL (and xQuery), PHP, and Java.
    I also had a small programming job involving server and client-side java.
.slide
  .from 2006
  .to 2009
  .slide-content
    I then worked at Santa Cruz Games right in 
    downtown Santa Cruz developing Video Games.
    I would say Embedded Systems, except it was fun.
.slide
  .from 2006
  .to 2009
  .slide-content
    I developed many different things there:
    %ul
      %li memory allocators,
      %li loading patterns,
      %li serializers,
      %li late 80's-type graphics engines,
      %li AI frameworks, and
      %li a localization framework.
.slide
  .from 2006
  .to 2009
  .slide-content
    I even developed a delta-loader for optimized transfer 
    to Sunplus development boards (for leapfrog).  We showed it to the 
    vendor and then it showed up in the next IDE revision.
.slide
  .from 2006
  .to 2009
  .slide-content
    I shipped lots of games,
    %ul
      %li Superman Returns (DS)
      %li Superman Returns - Fortress of Solitude (GBA) -- Highest rated superman game EVER
      %li Godzilla Double Smash (DS) -- Google: "The Worst DS Game Ever"
      %li Tombraider Underworld (DS)
      %li Spiderman v.s. the Masked Menace (Plug and Play)
      %li and more...
.slide
  .from 2008
  .to 2009
  .slide-content
    %p
      I did about 80% of the programming for Spiderman:  I wrote the tool,
      the engine, the gameplay, the AI systems, and all the level scripting.
      Everything but the art and the audio system.  It was a great 9 months.
.slide
  .from 2008
  .to 2009
  .slide-content
    The tool for Spiderman relied upon my reflection system for C++
    which adds some dynamic features to the language.  By this point
    I was combing a hardcopy of the ANSI/ISO standard for features
    I could use.  I bet you never heard of access declarations, neither had I.

    We used SCons for the the build system, so I learn a little python too.

        After Santa Cruz Games closed I spent some time at home
        and picked up Photography.  Sometimes I even think I 
        might be getting good.

      What brought me back to Santa Cruz
      was a rails startup called LineMonkey.  They're working on
      a Point of Sale running on HTML5.  They threw me at
      redeveloping the public online order interface and then the
      point-of-sale itself.
.slide

    I've got some time now, what will I do next?
